# spotutil

## Introduction
CLI tool to create, kill and list spot workers on AWS

Used by GFW staff to create / manage spot instances. Default instance ID is updated frequently to point at our preferred analysis AMI, which includes GDAL, gmt, and other common OSGEO packages.

## Requirements
Requires a `tokens` dir with .pem file to allow fab to enter the machine, in addition to proper AWS / EC2 permissions.


## Set-up
Try running

`aws s3 ls s3://gfw2-data/`

If this works, you should be good to go to continue to the **Install spotutil** section. If this does not work, you'll need to install aws command line client. This will put your aws credentials somewhere accessible by the tool.

Run

`pip install awscli`

When that completes, use your aws key and secret access key to establish aws credentials:

`aws configure`

Default region name: us-east-1

Default output format: json

## Install spotutil

`pip install git+http://github.com/wri/spotutil`

Once setup is complete, the tool can be run from any directory.

## Using spotutil

**Create a spot**

`spotutil new m4.large <key_pair>`

Instance types commonly used: m4.large, m4.xlarge, m4.2xlarge, m4.4xlarge, m4.10xlarge, m4.16xlarge

For `<key_pair>` use name for any key pair registered with your AWS account. Make sure you are in posession of the private key. You will need it to SSH into the machine

**Lists the active spots**

`spotutil ls`

**Remove an active spot**

`spotutil rm [--username][--interal_ip][--external_ip]`

Example: `spotutil rm --username sgibbes.local`
